## [Version 0.1.0]
### New
- Copied threaded fastener functions from `scad-tarmi`, with structural
  changes:
  - All interface functions take a map of options rather than a variary
    sequence.
  - No default bolt head type.
- Added specs for parameters to the `bolt` function as well as bolt length
  predictors.
